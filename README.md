Hey there, 
this is my graduation project.
It is an Onboaring Navigator for trainees.
The goal of the SPA is to support new trainees in the onboarding process.

The requirements for the project were:
MK-01: Modern, simple and intuitive design of the GUI.
MK-02: The GUI must be in the CD of the company.
MK-03: The already visited websites must be visualized with the help of checklists.
MK-04: The trainee finds all, for his training profession, important links within the application.
MK-05: The displayed links are already pre-sorted for the user. The sorting is done hierarchically, according to priority.
MK-06: The links are divided into quicklinks and task lists. The task lists in turn contain subtasks to be completed.
MK-07: A login is not required to use the application.
MK-08: The application must be accessible via the intranet.
MK-09: The application must be as easily expandable and maintainable as possible.

You can find unit-test and integration-tests in the view.component.spec.ts file.

What i want to do on this Repository in the future: Make the page responsive.

Look at the Screenshots of my solution here:
